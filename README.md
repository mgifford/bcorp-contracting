# B Corp Contracting
Providing example language for contracts and RFPs to help encourage BCorp adoption.

## Principals

- If we want to encourage adoption of BCorps, we have to influence the procurement process
- If companies are going to go through the effort to make the conversion to BCorps, they need to see that there is demand
- Organizations need to show that price isn't the only factor in their decision making

## Sample Language

In the selection process for this RFP, we will give preference to companies who are Certified B Corporations (B Corp). 

B Corp and other purpose driven entities will be given preference in the selection process.
