Purchasing policy

Thinkshift’s guiding principles in making purchases and choosing vendors are:
- Conserve resources
- Support companies that share our mission to create a more just, sustainable world

We strive to work with businesses that operate as sustainably as possible and to choose 
products that have the least environmental impact. We also encourage our clients to follow 
our environmental purchasing policy and to conduct their operations sustainably.

## Vendors 

Whenever possible, we work with and buy from Certified B Corps and benefit corporations, 
and businesses that are local, sustainably operated, and owned by women or under-represented populations. 
Our criteria for preferred vendors:
- Certified B Corporation or benefit corporation
- Located in the San Francisco Bay Area
- Operate sustainably with a triple bottom line
- Owned by women or people from under-represented populations
- Small businesses
- Active in the community and give back

## Products

We look for durable, long-lasting products. We reuse and recycle as much as possible. We 
avoid single-use products; when we must use them, we choose options that are compostable 
or recyclable. We prefer office supplies and equipment that meet the following criteria:
- Energy Star–rated or EPEAT-rated electronic equipment
- Recyclable or refillable/remanufactured toner and ink cartridges
- LED, CFL, or other energy-efficient lighting
- 100% PCW paper whenever possible; minimum standard is 30% PCW and 100% 
recycled content, chlorine-free processes, and FSC-certified chain of supply
- Vegetable-based inks for professionally printed material
- Janitorial supplies: cleaning products with no harmful chemicals or dyes; reusable 
cloths and natural fibers; 100% recycled content paper products when needed
- Used products if possible
- Made from recycled materials
- Made locally or in the U.S.
- Are not products of slave labor
