_ Although it doesn't actually mention B-Corp, it is encouraging to see them mention many aspects that many B Corp already support. 

##Choosing green suppliers

- We choose suppliers that offer sustainable products and services. For example, our Vancouver office uses a courier with hybrid electric vehicles and purchases office supplies from a company that has many green options. We use non-toxic biodegradable cleaning products in our offices, and our Vancouver office features organic hand soap made by David Suzuki's Queen of Green.
- We purchase fair trade organic coffee from Salt Spring Coffee, as well as organic tea. We also try to source local, organic, seasonal and vegetarian food for our office celebrations.
- We host green events whenever possible.
- We buy paper that is 100 per cent post-consumer recycled and/or FSC-certified, and processed chlorine free. This paper is used in our photocopier and printers, in most of our publications, as well as in paper and envelopes mailed to donors and supporters.
